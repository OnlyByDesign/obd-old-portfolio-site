    <div class="overlay__copy--main"><span>This issue of the concept magazine 'Process'</span><p> includes a feature article about the designer James Victore and his work. The challenge for this project was to build a magazine article with the concept being an individual artist and the impact their work has. By creating many assets by hand, with inspiration taken directly from the work of Victore, the results were bold and in-your-face; exactly the kind of treatment needed for a project like this.</p></div>
