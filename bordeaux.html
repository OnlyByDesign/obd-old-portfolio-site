    <div class="overlay__copy--main"><span>The Bordeaux Wine Festival</span><p> is a concept festival for wine connoisseurs old and young taking place on the outskirts of Bordeaux, France. I was tasked with designing a mailer piece that would adequitely explain the event, as well as being attractive enough for people to want to attend.

            <p class="two">Since the project was meant for all ages, the type had to be easy to read for every degree of eye-sight. High contrast colors and bolds iconography helped achieve this effect, which helped in keeping the text legible and dramatic.</p>
