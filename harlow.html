    <div class="overlay__copy--main"><span>Harlow & Grey</span><p> is a wholesaler, specializing in high-end party supplies. They came to me needing a visually appealing and aesthetically stunning catalog to showcase their products in the right light. Laying it out, working the type, and prepping for print all proved worth while after seeing the final piece for both the client and myself.</p></div>

        <h2 class="main"><q> I would definitely recommend Ben's services. He designed our company's LookBook for upcoming trade shows and took direction very well. The LookBook turned out great and is reflective of our company's brand image. Ben was super responsive and courteous. Excellent with meeting deadlines. We would love to work with Ben again for additional design work in the future. </q></h2>
