    <div class="overlay__copy--main"><span>Proxymate Cause is a startup</span><p> focusing on young voters, and their involvement in the political process by making their voices heard. Coming to me for a logo and landing page that needed to not only look good, but make a point, I delivered a project that did exactly that. Utilizing found imagery, iconography, and a bold typeface with a logo designed to be just as bold, I turned over work that filled the roll nicely.</p></div>

        <p class="two">With as much back and forth with the logo as with the web page, it's no surprise that a major part of this project was the focus on branding, and the message it delivered. </p>
        <p class="two">After finalizing the logo, the site essentially built itself - bold and clear, it sends the message resoundingly with little room for mistake; we need to be heard!</p>

With each delivery of work, he communicated thoroughly. In the end, he created some really beautiful work. I would definitely work with Ben again for my next design need! </q></h2>
