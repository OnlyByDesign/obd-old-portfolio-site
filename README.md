# obd-old-portfolio-site
OnlyByDesign | Old portfolio site that sucked | Maybe another time... | HTML/CSS | JS | ES5 | ES6 | AJAX | XMLHTTPREQUEST | Anime.js

My goal was to create an awesome portfolio site after taking Jonas Schmedtmanns 2019 Complete JS Course

The site didn't come out the way I wanted, but I learned a lot about: 
1. Closures
2. Event delegation
3. XMLHTTPREQUEST
4. Anime.JS
5. Polyfilling and customization
6. Throttling
7. DOM Manipulation

**I think I tried to start running before I could walk; there is still so much to learn.**

My main.js is really just *function junction*!
