OnlyByDesign | Old portfolio site that sucked | Maybe another time... | HTML/CSS | JS | ES5 | ES6 | AJAX | XMLHTTPREQUEST | Anime.js

My goal was to create an awesome portfolio site after taking Jonas Schmedtmanns 2019 Complete JS Course

The site didn't come out the way I wanted, but I learned a lot about: 
1. Closures
2. Event delegation
3. XMLHTTPREQUEST
4. Anime.JS
5. Polyfilling and customization
6. Throttling
7. DOM Manipulation

**I think I tried to start running before I could walk; there is still so much to learn.**

My main.js is really just *function junction*! 

Some of the more challenging items included in main.js:
1. 608: Calling the site content, building a div to house the data, while applying an Anime function. It actually looked kinda cool.
2. 309: Accounting for all possible changes to the body of the page, and resetting based on those.
3. 272: The XmlHTtpRequest itself was a lot of handle, and I learned a lot about POST and GET calls (at least how they were done).
4. 98: Learning about width and height relative to JS and how to maniupate the DOM based on that.
5. 131: Handling data through the DOM and serving it up concurrently against other functions.
